Duration: [Jan 2025 â€“ May 2025]
Role: Team Leader
Tools & Skills: Process Design | Mass & Energy Balances | Cost Estimation | Sustainability | MS Excel | MATLAB
Description:
Designed and developed a biogas generation system to convert hostel kitchen food waste into clean, renewable energy using anaerobic digestion. 
Conducted process modeling, equipment sizing, and energy balance calculations for components such as shredders, digesters, and centrifuges. 
Estimated daily energy consumption (68 kWh/day) and optimized cost-efficiency ($5.73/day). Evaluated environmental benefits including waste reduction, GHG mitigation, and biofertilizer generation. 
Proposed a scalable solution for institutional and rural applications.
